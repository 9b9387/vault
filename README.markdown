NOT YET RELEASED, AND NOT NECESSARILY STABLE. DON'T STORE YOUR PASSWORDS WITH
THIS JUST YET.

Simple password generator. Given a passphrase and the name of a service, returns
a strong password for that service. You only need to remember your passphrase,
which you do not give to anyone, and this program will give a different password
for every service you use. The passphrase can be any text you like.

Given the same passphrase and service name, the program will generate the same
result every time, so you can use it to 'look up' those impossible-to-remember
passwords when you need them.

According to [Dropbox's zxcvbn password strength measure](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/209/zxcvbn/test/index.html),
if your dictionary English password takes about a second to crack, those
generated by `vault` take over a million times the age of the observable
universe to crack by brute force.


## Why?

I have a terrible memory and like keeping my stuff safe. [Strong service-specific
passwords are hard to remember](http://xkcd.com/936/), and many services [have
stupid restrictions on passwords](http://me.veekun.com/blog/2011/12/04/fuck-passwords/).
I want to remember one phrase and have a machine deal with making my passwords
strong.


## Installation

This program is written in JavaScript and is available as a Node program:

    npm install -g vault


## Usage

The most basic usage involves passing your passphrase and the service name; when
you pass the `-p` flag you will be prompted for your passphrase:

    $ vault google -p
    Passphrase: *********
    2hk!W[-32r{I=~=kJ&{l

You can set the desired length using `-l`:

    $ vault google -p -l 6
    Passphrase: *********
    Tc8k~y

You can control the character types present in the output, either to disable
certain types or make sure they are present. For example, to get a password with
no symbols in it:

    $ vault google -p --symbol 0
    Passphrase: *********
    Bb4uFmAEUnTPJh23ecdQ

To get a password containing at least one dash and uppercase letter:

    $ vault google -p --dash 1 --upper 1
    Passphrase: *********
    2-[wA85]?EWiu >OMPBI

Available character classes include:

* `lower`: lowercase letters, `a`-`z`
* `upper`: uppercase letters, `A`-`Z`
* `number`: the digits `0`-`9`
* `space`: the space character ` `
* `dash`: dashes (`-`) and underscores (`_`)
* `symbol`: all other printable ASCII characters

Finally, some sites do not allow passwords containing strings of repeated
characters beyond a certain length. For example, a site requiring passwords not
to contain more than two of the same character in a row would reject the
password `ZOMG!!!` because of the 3 `!` characters. Vault lets you express this
requirement using `-r` or `--repeat`; this option sets the maximum number of
times the same character can appear in a row.

    $ vault google -p -r 2


## Saving your settings

If you like, you can store your passphrase on disk; `vault` will save it in a
file called `.vault` in your home directory.

The `.vault` file is encrypted with AES-256, using your username as the key by
default. You can set your own key using the `VAULT_KEY` environment variable.
You can also change the location of the file using the `VAULT_PATH` variable,
for example you might set `VAULT_PATH=Dropbox/.vault` to sync it using Dropbox.
If you do this, make sure any files containing the key are NOT also exposed to
third-party services.

To save your passphrase, pass the `--config` or `-c` flag:

    $ vault -c -p
    Passphrase: *********
    $ vault google
    2hk!W[-32r{I=~=kJ&{l

You can also configure character class settings this way:

    $ vault -c --alpha 0
    $ vault google -p
    Passphrase: *********
    <1\<')3><*^/@]-7@-(^

Both the passphrase and the character class settings can be overridden on a
per-service basis:

    $ vault -c twitter --alpha 1 --symbol 0
    
    $ vault twitter -p
    Passphrase: *********
    Z2juOG1Z31BX1A9jA54B
    
    $ vault google -p
    Passphrase: *********
    <1\<')3><*^/@]-7@-(^


## How does it work?

`vault` takes your passphrase and a service name and generates a hash from them
using [PBKDF2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2). It then encodes the bits of
this hash using a 94-character alphabet, subject to the given character
constraints. This design makes sure that each password is very hard to break by
brute force, and ensures that the discovery of one service's password does not
lead to other accounts being compromised. It also means you can tailor the
output to the character set accepted by each service.
