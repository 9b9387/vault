        <h1>I understand you have questions.</h1>
        
        <h2>Who are you?</h2>
        
        <p>This site was made by <a href="http://jcoglan.com">James Coglan</a>.
          I write open-source software for the Web.</p>
        
        <h2>Why should I trust you?</h2>
        
        <p>This site does not store or transmit any data you enter into it. It
          contains no analytics scripts, tracking cookies or other pieces of
          spyware. The passwords it generates are much more secure than most
          people use, against brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks and
          password database theft.</p>
        
        <p>According to <a
          href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/209/zxcvbn/test/index.html">Dropbox&rsquo;s
          zxcvbn password strength measure</a>, if your dictionary English
          password takes about a second to crack, those generated by Vault take
          over a million times the age of the observable universe to crack by
          brute force.</p>
        
        <h2>Fine, but I still don&rsquo;t trust you.</h2>
        
        <p>And why should you, after all I am just some guy from the Internet.
          However, this software is open-source (released under the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT license</a>)
          and you can <a href="http://github.com/jcoglan/vault">take a look at
          its source code</a>.</p>
        
        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        
        <p>It takes your passphrase and a service name and signs the service
          name with the passphrase using HMAC-SHA256. It then encodes the bits
          of this hash using a 92-character alphabet, subject to the given
          character constraints. This design makes sure that each password is
          very hard to break by brute force, and ensures that the discovery of
          one service&rsquo;s password does not lead to other accounts being
          compromised. It also means you can tailor the output to the character
          set accepted by each service.</p>
        
        <h2>What can I use as my passphrase?</h2>
        
        <p>Absolutely any text you like. A good passphrase should consist of a
          few words you can easily remember but would be hard to guess, like a
          quotation or a song lyric.</p>
        
        <p>Using a few words rather than some string of letters and numbers
          makes it easier for you to remember but harder for attackers to guess.
          But, many online services restrict the characters you can use, making
          you less safe. This tool lets you convert your passphrase into
          something each service will accept.</p>
        
        <h2>Is there a command line version?</h2>
        
        <p>Of course there is. If you have <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node</a>
          installed, run <tt>npm install -g vault</tt>. You&rsquo;ll also want
          to take a look at the <a href="http://github.com/jcoglan/vault">readme</a>.</p>
